# SpamClassifier

Uses a SVM trained on some training spam data to classify emails as spam(1) or not spam(0).

To use, paste the email you wanna check in the email.txt file. Or make your own txt file for the email you wanna
detect and name it email.txt

The given email.txt file is a dummy file with an example mail inside. 

After saving your email.txt file with the mail you wanna check, run the "main.m" script on GNU Octave's command line like this-
# >> main

It'll detect if the mail provided in email.txt is spam or not.
